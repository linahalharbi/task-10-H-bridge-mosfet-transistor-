the transistor i chose is p-channel mosfet type ( IRF4905) . recent tests made on this type of p-mos showed that this type has a  low resistance  which can deliver more power to the motor. other types like IRF630 n-channel and IRF9630 p-channel MOSFETs are high in resistance which wastes the power they also runs hot as well   .
